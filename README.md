# iOffice OAuth


## Development

Running `gulp` in root directory will watch over the oauth library
and update the files in `dist` and in the `demo` directory. If `gulp`
is not installed then try `npm install`.

### Mobile Demo

To develop make sure to run `gulp` as previously mentioned then in the
`demo` directory run either

    ionic serve --port [port-number]

or

    ionic run [platform]

to try the demo.

Note that you may need to run `bower install` in the `demo` directory.
